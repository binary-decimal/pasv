### Homework Book Management System

CLI library system allows users to manage books using basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 

##### Overview
The main loop greets the user and displays a menu with options to view, modify, add, or delete books. The system continues until the user chooses to exit. 
Books are stored in MockGlobalStorage, which provides a runtime-only mock storage using a static list.
