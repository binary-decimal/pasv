    You do not talk about the FIGHT CLUB LICENSE.
    You DO NOT talk about the FIGHT CLUB LICENSE.
    If someone says "stop" or goes limp — or taps out — the project is over.
    Only two developers to a project.
    One project at a time.
    No shirts, no shoes.
    Projects will go on as long as they have to.
    If this is your first time reading the FIGHT CLUB LICENSE, you HAVE to license your next project under the FIGHT CLUB LICENSE.
